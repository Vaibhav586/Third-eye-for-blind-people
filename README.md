AI/IoT Navigation Assistant for Visually Impaired Individuals
#Overview
This project presents an AI/IoT solution tailored to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings independently and safely. Leveraging generative AI and object detection techniques, our system provides real-time analysis of the environment, detecting obstacles such as walls and stairs. Through IoT integration, users receive timely alerts via sound or vibration, enhancing situational awareness and facilitating seamless navigation. By merging innovation with inclusivity, our project empowers the visually impaired community, fostering greater autonomy and quality of life.
